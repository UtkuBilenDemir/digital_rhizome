# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

My name is Utku and this is my digital rhizome. I'm trying to find an effective system to;

  1. organise my partly hand-written, partly digitalised (and in both cases in varyingly formatted) notes,
  2. effectively enter and reflect on my daily notes/ideas,
  3. establish a source for creative work.

The free and open source digital garden format I'm using right now is created by Maxime Vaillancourt and is [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  If I manage to get the hang of it, <span style="font-weight: bold">[[my-first-note]]</span> will be here.
</p>

  .wrapper {
